These are not explicitly user support channels, although they're likely a good place to find someone who can answer your question if you ask nicely.\n\n* **Slack:** [#general on the GraphQL Slack](https://graphql.slack.com/messages/general/) [(Get an invite)](https://graphql-slack.herokuapp.com/)\n* **IRC:** [#graphql on freenode](https://freenode.net/)\n\n#### Discord\n\n* [Everything GraphQL: Curated By The Guild](https://discord.gg/xud7bH9)\n* [#graphql on the ReactiFlux Discord](http://join.reactiflux.com/)\n\n### Vendor channels\n\nThe following channels are maintained by vendors, and may be a good place to find help on their products.\n\n* [Apollo Slack](http://apollostack.com/#slack)\n* [Graphile Discord](https://discord.gg/graphile)\n* [Prisma Slack](https://slack.prisma.io/)\n\n## Blogs\n\nHere are a list of notable blog posts to help you better understand GraphQL:\n\n- [GraphQL: A data query language](/blog/graphql-a-query-language/) - Lee Byron\n- [Subscriptions in GraphQL and Relay](/blog/subscriptions-in-graphql-and-relay/) - Dan Schafer and Laney Kuenzel\n- [Mocking your server is easy with GraphQL](/blog/mocking-with-graphql/) - Jonas Helfer\n- [Wrapping a REST API in GraphQL](/blog/rest-api-graphql-wrapper/) - Steven Luscher\n- [Leaving technical preview](/blog/production-ready/) - Lee Byron\n- [Relicensing the GraphQL specification](https://medium.com/@leeb/relicensing-the-graphql-specification-e7d07a52301b) - Lee Byron\n- [GraphQL Introduction](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/05/01/graphql-introduction.html) - Nick Schrock\n- [From REST to GraphQL](https://0x2a.sh/from-rest-to-graphql-b4e95e94c26b#.tag7nzkrb) - Jacob Gillespie\n- [GraphQL Explained](https://medium.com/apollo-stack/graphql-explained-5844742f195e#.zdykxos6i) - Jonas Helfer\n- [GraphQL Concepts Visualized](https://medium.com/apollo-stack/the-concepts-of-graphql-bc68bd819be3#.hfczgtdsj) - Dhaivat Pandya\n- [Building the f8 App: Using GraphQL & Relay](http://makeitopen.com/docs/en/1-A2-relay.html)\n- [Your First GraphQL Server](https://medium.com/the-graphqlhub/your-first-graphql-server-3c766ab4f0a2#.ovn0y19k4) - Clay Allsopp\n- [Tutorial: Kick start a JS API with Apollo-server, Dataloader and Knex](https://bamtech.gitbook.io/dev-standards/backend/graphql-js/getting-started-with-apollo-server-dataloader-knex.mo) - Thomas Pucci\n- [Tutorial: How to Build a GraphQL Server](https://medium.com/apollo-stack/tutorial-building-a-graphql-server-cddaa023c035#.bu6sdnst4) - Jonas Helfer\n- [Designing Powerful APIs with GraphQL Query Parameters](https://www.graph.cool/docs/tutorials/designing-powerful-apis-with-graphql-query-parameters-aing7uech3/) - Johannes Schickling\n- [GraphQL and the amazing Apollo Client](https://medium.com/google-developer-experts/graphql-and-the-amazing-apollo-client-fe57e162a70c) - Gerard Sans\n- [GraphQL Server Basics (Part I): The Schema](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-server-basics-the-schema-ac5e2950214e) - Nikolas Burk\n- [GraphQL Server Basics (Part II): The Network Layer](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-server-basics-the-network-layer-51d97d21861) - Nikolas Burk\n- [GraphQL Server Basics (Part III): Demystifying the `info` argument in GraphQL resolvers](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-server-basics-demystifying-the-info-argument-in-graphql-resolvers-6f26249f613a) - Nikolas Burk\n- [A Beginner’s Guide to GraphQL](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-beginners-guide-to-graphql-86f849ce1bec/) - Leonardo Maldonado\n- [Architecture of a high performance GraphQL to SQL engine](https://blog.hasura.io/architecture-of-a-high-performance-graphql-to-sql-server-58d9944b8a87) - Hasura\n\n## Videos\n\nDevelopers inside and outside of Facebook have given talks about GraphQL at conferences and meetups around the world.

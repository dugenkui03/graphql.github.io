The GraphQL Foundation encourages contributions, stewardship, and a shared investment from a broad group in vendor-neutral events, documentation, tools, and support for GraphQL.\n\nGraphQL was created in 2012 and open sourced by Facebook in 2015. In 2019, Facebook and others [created the GraphQL Foundation](https://foundation.graphql.org/news/2019/03/12/the-graphql-foundation-announces-collaboration-with-the-joint-development-foundation-to-drive-open-source-and-open-standards/) as a neutral, non-profit home for the GraphQL assets and ongoing collaboration, and hosted by [The Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org). The GraphQL Foundation is a fully neutral home for the GraphQL trademark, and provides a means of collecting and distributing membership dues to support core community infrastructure and programs.\n\n## The GraphQL Foundation supports the community\n\nThe primary mission of the GraphQL Foundation is to ensure that the GraphQL community is able to focus on the continued evolution of the [specification](https://spec.graphql.org) and [reference implementations](/code/). We accomplish this through a number of core activities:\n\n* Funding grants for project maintainers and community gardeners.\n* Coordinating and funding mentorship programs.\n* Providing collaboration infrastructure.\n* Managing the GraphQL trademark and related policies.\n* Providing legal support for projects.\n* Operational and logistical support through The Linux Foundation.\n\nThe GraphQL Foundation works in close collaboration with the [GraphQL Working Group](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/) and the [GraphQL TSC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/GraphQL-TSC.md).\n\n## Members support the GraphQL Foundation\n\nThe GraphQL Foundation would like to thank [our current members](/foundation/members/) for their ongoing support to ensure the sustainability of the GraphQL ecosystem. Learn more about how your company can demonstrate its commitment to GraphQL by [becoming a member of the GraphQL Foundation](https://graphql.org/foundation/join).\n\n\nIf you have questions, you can reach out to [membership@graphql.org](mailto:membership@graphql.org).\n\n\n"},"nextDoc":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Annual Reports","permalink":"/foundation/annual-reports/"}}},"pageContext":{"permalink":"/foundation/","nextPermalink":"/foundation/annual-reports/","sideBarData":[{"name":"GraphQL Foundation","links":[{"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/graphql.github.io/graphql.github.io/src/content/foundation/About.md","parent":{"relativeDirectory":"foundation","sourceInstanceName":"content"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What is the GraphQL Foundation?","permalink":"/foundation/","next":"/foundation/annual-reports/","category":"GraphQL Foundation","sublinks":null,"sidebarTitle":"About the Foundation","date":null,"tags":null},"id":"aca8f4e4-f2fc-5fe5-b0b2-931a8767b1c0"},{"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/graphql.github.io/graphql.github.io/src/content/foundation/AnnualReports.md","parent":{"relativeDirectory":"foundation","sourceInstanceName":"content"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Annual Reports","permalink":"/foundation/annual-reports/","next":"/foundation/contact/","category":"GraphQL Foundation","sublinks":null,"sidebarTitle":"Annual Reports","date":null,"tags":null},"id":"7de982dc-b5bd-505d-b1d0-690e44cd559c"},{"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/graphql.github.io/graphql.github.io/src/content/foundation/Contact.md","parent":{"relativeDirectory":"foundation","sourceInstanceName":"content"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Contact the GraphQL Foundation","permalink":"/foundation/contact/","next":"/foundation/join/","category":"GraphQL Foundation","sublinks":"Membership Inquriries,Membership Support,Meeting Logistics,Media Inquries,Technical Issues,General","sidebarTitle":"Contact us","date":null,"tags":null},"id":"6b565dc5-b6d4-5c8e-bb30-7ae42c072b00"},{"fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/graphql.github.io/graphql.github.io/src/content/foundation/Join.md","parent":{"relativeDirectory":"foundation","sourceInstanceName":"content"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Become a Member","permalink":"/foundation/join/","next":"/foundation/members/","category":"GraphQL Foundation","sublinks":"GraphQL Specification,GraphQL Foundation","sidebarTitle":"Join GraphQL","date":null,"tags":null},"id":"7b32b2ba-e128-5e41-9b79-e44fbdd6e895"},{"frontmatter":{"sidebarTitle":"Foundation Members","title":"Foundation Members","permalink":"/foundation/members/","date":null,"category":"GraphQL Foundation"}}]}],"sourcePath":"src/content/foundation/About.md"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1581580458","4162432391"]}
